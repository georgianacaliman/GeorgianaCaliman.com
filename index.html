								<p>Hi! I'm Georgiana. I'm trained in Communication, Cognitive Psychology, and Programming. I've spent the past few years working in London, Amsterdam, and Bucharest. I'm passionate about technology and how it shapes the world. You can check out some of my <a href="#work"> work</a>.</p>
								<p>I'm proactive, adaptable, and results-oriented. I combine a growth mindset with a successful blend of enthusiasm, self-discipline, and intrinsic motivation to achieve results. I love continuous learning and personal development, therefore I take every opportunity to do so. So far, I studied, worked, and lived in Romania, France, UK, and The Netherlands. In 2016, I took a sabbatical year and explored over 20 countries, on 3 continents, cultivating an outstanding cultural awareness.</p>

								<p>This website is put together by me, using a template built by aj@lkn.io, and hosted on GitHub Pages - this is my attempt to tinker with code.</p>
								<p>Lately, I've been learning Python, AI and Machine Learning concepts. I've recently taken some cloud computing courses, and I had the chance to teach ML fundamentals to young students over the 2021 summer.</p>
